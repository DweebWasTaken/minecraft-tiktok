It's quite simple, first off you can use any TikKok account.

Open any TikTok Live Stream (**You have to use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge**) > Press F12 (Developer console will open) > Switch to Application tab > Select Cookies on the left side > Take the value of Cookie called `sessionid` > Place that inside config under `RoomID` > `sessionId`
